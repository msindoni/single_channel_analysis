    "Ion channels are one of the most relevant and important classes of proteins that are involved in a seeming infinite range or physiological processes such as action potential propagation, muscle contraction, cell-cell communication, mitosis, bone formation, vision, adution, gustation, etc. Additionally, there are various different classes of ion channels based on the type of stimuli that activates them such as ligand-gated, voltage-gated, mechano-gated, and pH-gated. Although they differ widly in their function, structure, location, gating kinetics, and expression, all ion channels exhibit two fundamental properties; reversal potential and unitary conductance. These two properties are what will be explored in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to do that, first, you will import real data collected using cell-attached voltage clamp with Neuro2a cells which the mechanosensitive ion channel piezo1. Next you will go through the basics of single-channel openings and what raw electrophysiological data looks like. Next, you will isolate individual single-channel opening events and determine the amplitude of the current passing through the channel at a given voltage. And lastly, using this information, you will learn how to determine both the reversal potential and single channel conductance of piezo1.\n",

Therefore, a frequency histogram of the current values allows you to make an ccurate estimate of that that \"true current\" value.\n",

    "# Unitary Conductance and Reversal Potential\n",
    "\n",
    "At different votages, the amout of current that will pass through a channel will change. This is due to the fact that with increased voltage differences across the membrane, the larger the driving force will be and therefore the greater the number of ions passing through a channel will be. For example, if you are looking at an ion channel that is a non-selective cation channel, a membrane potential of -60mV will result in a weaker driving force for positivly charged ions to enter the cell through the channel than a cell with a membrane potential of -80mV. Because of this property, you are able to generate I (current )/ V (voltage) curves. An example trace is shown below.\n",

    "<img src=\"notebook_images\\example_iv.PNG\" width=900>\n",

    "From these graphs, there are two major channel properties that can be determined. The first is the reversal potential of the channel. This is the voltage at which the currents of a channel switch from being inward (negative) to outward (positive) or, more simply, where the I/V curve crosses the x-axis. This value is useful in that it gives some insight into the selectivity of the channel. For example, if a channel has a reveral potential around -80mV, that channel is most likely potassium selective since -80 is the equilibrium potential for potassium. Additionally, if a channel has a reveral potential around +60mV, that channel is most likely sodium selective since +60 is the equilibrium potential for sodium.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the example trace, the reversal potential is around 0mV which indictaes that the channel is a non-selective cation channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second property that can be determined from an I/V curve is the unitary conductance of the channel. This is a measure of how much current will pass through a channel at a given voltage and can be expressed as the following equation: \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"notebook_images\\unitary_conductance_equation.PNG\">\n",
    "\n",
    "where i is current, V is voltage, and g is conductance measured in Siemens. This value, in conjunction with the reversal potential, acts as a identifier for specific ion channels since each channel will have a different unitary conductance.\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine both the reversal potential and unitary conductance, you will need to fit your data with a linear fit. For your data, this is possible since at the voltages being recorded from, the channel has a unitary current that is directly proportional to the voltage provided. And since you have three different voltages, you should be able to exrapolate both an x-intercept (reversal potential) and unitary conductance (slope).\n",
    "\n",
